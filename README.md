### 🔥 About Me

Hey there! I'm **Anuraag**, a curious mind blending tech, discipline, and real-world ambition.

- 🎓 Currently pursuing **B.Tech in Artificial Intelligence & Data Science** at **M. Kumarasamy College of Engineering**
- 💭 I’m deeply into **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, and **Data Analysis** — not just to learn, but to apply.
- 📊 I’m exploring how data drives decisions, and how that knowledge can support **real business**, like my father’s manufacturing firm.
- 🧠 I'm also working on becoming more **disciplined** — building routines, creating structure, and staying focused.
- 🛠️ I’ve built several mini-projects in Python, Flask, and C — some basic, some experimental — but all a part of my growth.
- 💬 I don’t show everything upfront — but ask me, and I’ll gladly walk you through the logic and learning behind them.

> *“Right now, I’m not chasing perfection. I’m building my pace, my way.”*

### 📦 Projects So Far

> *Not all projects are masterpieces — but each one taught me something.*

- 🏋️‍♂️ **Personal Gym Trainer App (Python)** – Suggests workouts, tracks BMI, and supports login.
- 🗳️ **Voting Management System (C)** – Structured DS-based system using stacks, trees, and linear lists.
- 💰 **Loan Approval Analysis (Python)** – ML-based approval predictor using data visualization.
- 🎮 **Gesture Controlled Mouse (Python + OpenCV)** – Uses hand tracking for cursor control and clicks.
- 📊 **Sales Data Visualizer (Python + Matplotlib)** – Turns CSV data into graphs, pie charts, and heatmaps.

> 💬 *Some are still evolving — ask me about them if you're curious.*
